Moving Out Sale Project

This Project was made out of necessity. It helped me manage and advertise items I wished to sell when moving out. This platform simplifies the process of listing items for sale, such as clothes racks, snow boots, and other household items, by providing an easy-to-use interface for adding, deleting, and updating product listings.
